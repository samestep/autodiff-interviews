# Autodiff Interviews

This repository details a 2025 interview study about [automatic differentiation (autodiff)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), conducted at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) by [Sam Estep](https://samestep.com/) and [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). The goal of this study is to identify the needs of people who are or could be using autodiff tools, and any gaps between those needs and the set of autodiff capabilities currently developed or researched.

The study is split into two parts, one for (potential) _users_ of autodiff, and one for autodiff _experts_ who have authored relevant tools or papers. To find people to interview, we have two Google Forms:

- [Autodiff user study form](https://forms.gle/m3h5FkXRvU7fRR7C6)
- [Autodiff expert study form](https://forms.gle/UcJT6RFnwruDsb8C7)

On each form, we ask whether the participant would be willing for the audio recording and/or text transcript of their interview to be made public. All such public recordings and transcripts can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XNBbRsqg1KVZ-NLMRgJTap7pl6tSgQEi). Contents of the other interviews are not public.
